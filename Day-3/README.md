# Day 3

The premise of day is to find the shortest distance to a wire intersection.

## Part 1

For the first part, the closest intersection is found by using the manhattan distance calculation `l = x + y`.

### Execution Time

| Average Time (ms) | Standard Deviation (ms) |

| 221.9307624 | 4.086840613 |

## Part 2

For the second part, the closest intersection is found by using the sum of the length of the wires at the intersection. The length only being counted from the origin to the intersection.
