# Day 2

The premise of day is to repair the gravity assist computer.

## Part 1

For the first part, you had to implement a system that took opcodes and parameters as input and then produced output based upon the operation dictated.

### Execution Time

| Average Time (ms) | Standard Deviation (ms) |

## Part 2

For the second part, you had to use the system from the first part to find 2 numbers that would result in an output of `19690720`. My implementation of this is awful as brute force was the only solution I could come up with, and the memory reset implementation is egregious.
