# Day 6

The premise of day is to build a map of celestial orbits and then do math using it.

## Part 1

For the first part, the map must be constructed and then all orbits counted

### Execution Time

| Average Time (ms) | Standard Deviation (ms) |
| :---: | :---: |
| 818.00777 | 1.6567378 |

## Part 2

For the second part, the map that was previously constructed is to be used to determine how many orbits are between yourself and santa.

### Execution Time

| Average Time (ms) | Standard Deviation (ms) |
| :---: | :---: |
| 4.3294567 | 0.1573935 |

## Special Requirements

It is possible to solve this without the usage of the libraries listed below, however that would be at the cost of sanity.
